## Features
For the first version I thought this project to have 5 sections
<ul>
  <li> Home: To have an introduction, technologies I use, a little section for the projects, seft skills,  laboral experience and education.</li>
  <li> Portfolio (In progress): To have every project with more details than are in the main section.</li>
  <li> Certifications: To have the details for every course I've taken</li>
  <li> Personal (In progress): To have my blog and tutorials </li>
  <li> About (In progress): Think to put my personal bio, my hobbies, the auto download for my CV and other software I work with </li>
</ul>
